1. man -k COMMAND

2. Command "which cp wc" shows us that cp program is located at /bin/cp while wc is located at /usr/bin/wc.

3. Command "find /usr/bin/?" shows us that there are three such programs: [, w, and X.
[ is the condition evaluation utility. It evaluates the expression and, if it evaluates to true, returns a zero (true) exit status; otherwise it returns 1 (false). If there is no expression, test also returns 1 (false). 
w displays who is logged in and what they are doing. 
X is a portable, network-transparent window system 

4. Command "ls -l $(which emacs)" shows us that it is linked to /etc/alternatives/emacs
