1. I want to extract only the lines containing the table elements out of the
HTML files. So I used the grep command. It turned out that grep does not 
support regular expression "+". It came to my mind that it might be a 
feature of modern regular expression. As an attempt, I used egrep and it 
worked.

2. Continue to work with the previous results, it seems that the English 
terms are in the even lines (first line being 0). We used a sed command to 
only keep the odd lines that contain the Hawaiian vocabularies.

3. I then used the command provided in the slides, namely 
sed -E 's/<[^>]*>//g' 
to remove all the HTML tags.

4. Remove all the blanks
tr -d '[:blank:]'

5. Reject terms that contain non-Hawaiian characters
egrep [pk\'mnwlhaeiou] | \

6. Turn all the upper case letters into lower case; also convert ` to '; 
Finally sort and remove duplicated terms
tr "A-Z\`" "a-z'"
sort -u

7. I then saved the cleaned list of Hawaii words to a local file with 
command
cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords

8. Now we can use
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords 
as a Hawaiian word spelling checker. 

9. Counting the number of "misspelled" English words in the website with
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words | wc -l
we get 181.

10. Counting the number of "misspelled" Hawaiian words in the website with
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l
we get 453.

11. Storing the outputs of the misspelled words in both English and Hawaiian
by redirecting the output to local files instead of wc. The English ones are
stored in mewords, while the Hawaiian ones are stored in mhwords.

12. Finally, we use
comm -3 mewords mhwords
to see if there are words only in either file. The first column of the output
will be the words only in mewords, the words only "misspelled" in English,
while the second column will be the ones only in mhwords.

13. So the only word that is only "misspelled" in English is wiki. While with
comm -13 mewords mhwords | wc -l
it shows that there are 273 words only "misspelled" in Hawaiian, as expected.
Some of these words are:
the, then, want, write...
