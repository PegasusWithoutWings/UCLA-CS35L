1. Use 
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to download the desired version of coreutils to my seas server.

2. Use
tar â€“xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to unzip the file.

3. Use
mkdir coreutils
to make a directory for the installment of the downloaded coreutils.

4. Get into the unzipped coreutils-7.6 and read the INSTALL file as required.

5. Get the full directory path of the coreutils directory and use it as the
prefix for configure.

6. Type
./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classtzh/CS35L/assign3/coreutils
to properly configure the make.

7. Type
make
to build the files.

8. Type
make install
to install the package.

9. Enter the bin directory of coreutils and attempt to reproduce the bug with
ls -l

10. The date of the files is incorrectly displayed with format similar to
2009-03-02 06:22
Bug successfully reproduced.

11. Go to the archived workaround published in GNU website in 
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html
and copy & paste the patch into local file patch.diff.

12. Modified the path names on the top of the patch.diff so that it displays:
./ls.c
for both +++ and ---.

13. Move patch.diff to coreutils-7.6/src/ and execute
patch -p0 < patch.diff
to apply the patch. The standard Output shows that the patch is successfully
applied.

14. Stay in coreutils-7.6/src/ and run 
./ls -l
We observe that now the date is correctly displayed.

Q1:
Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because there was a 
goto statement that goes to that line and has the date displayed with the 
incorrect date format specified below that line.

It is not necessary from a purely functional point of view, because even if we
leave it unchanged, the second part will remove the only goto statement to
that label. However, from a code maintainance point of view, it is necessary
because unused code should not be kept in the code base.

Q2:
I do not think that it will cause troubles in non-English speaking countries 
as it still uses the data format set by the LC_TIME variable, which will
be correctly adjusted based on the language of the user.

The general thing to watch out is whether there will be further dependence on
the modified code.
