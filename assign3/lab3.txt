1. Use 
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to download the desired version of coreutils to my seas server.

2. Use
tar â€“xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to unzip the file.

3. Use
mkdir coreutils
to make a directory for the installment of the downloaded coreutils.

4. Get into the unzipped coreutils-7.6 and read the INSTALL file as required.

5. Get the full directory path of the coreutils directory and use it as the
prefix for configure.

6. Type
./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classtzh/CS35L/assign3/coreutils
to properly configure the make so the package will be installed in the desired
directory, coreutils, instead of the directory containing the source code.

7. Type
make
to build the files.

8. Type
make install
to install the package.

9. Enter the bin directory of coreutils and attempt to reproduce the bug with
./ls -l

10. The date of the files is incorrectly displayed with format similar to
2009-03-02 06:22
Bug successfully reproduced.

11. Go to the archived workaround published in GNU website in 
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html
and copy & paste the patch into local file patch.diff.

12. Modified the path names on the top of the patch.diff so that it displays:
./ls.c
for both +++ and ---.

13. Move patch.diff to coreutils-7.6/src/ and execute
patch -p0 < patch.diff
to apply the patch. The standard Output shows that the patch is successfully
applied.

14. Stay in coreutils-7.6/src/ and run 
./ls -l
We observe that now the date is correctly displayed.

15. Use 
touch newfile
to create a new file.

16. Use 
touch --date="2016-01-01" oldfile
to create a file that is at least one year old.

17. Change directory into assign3 folder that contains both coreutils and
coreutils-7.6, and execute the buggy version of ls on both newfile and oldfile,
we get
./coreutils/bin/ls -l newfile oldfile
we get
-rw-r--r-- 1 classtzh class 0 2018-02-01 16:05 newfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 classtzh class 0 2016-01-01 00:00 oldfile

18. Then we execute the patched version on the same two files again, and get
-rw-r--r-- 1 classtzh class 0 Feb  1 16:05 newfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 classtzh class 0 Jan  1  2016 oldfile
as desired.
