    "A **byte string** is in essence the internal representation of string as it is stored in the computer. The commonly known UTF-8, US-ASCII, and Unicode are all **character encoding system** that converts the corresponding string and byte string from and to each other. Depending on the system, the same string can be encoded into different byte strings; similarly, the same byte string representation can be decoded into different strings. When we see garbage characters or Mojibake when opening a file, it is usually because the file is decoded with the unintended character encoding.\n",
