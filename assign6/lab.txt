# Lab 6: Multithread performance

Here we are going to test the performance advantage of multithreaded sort. First we need to generate a testing file big enough so that the sort program would actually take a measureable amount of time to finish the task.

```bash
od -A n -t fF -N 40000000 < /dev/urandom |
tr -s '[:blank:]' '[\n*]' |
sed '/^$/d' >
rand_flost.txt
```

In the above commands, `od` extract 40000000 bytes from /dev/urandom, which generates random bytes, and format them into 10000000 floating point numbers.
