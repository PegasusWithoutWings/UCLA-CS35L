    "Because I am using the latest version of Macbook Pro that does not even have USB port, it took me some extra trouble to set the Baglebone up. First I have to borrow a Windows laptop from my friend and then walk through the setup instructions posted in Piazza. Then, after I get it connected to UCLA_WIFI, I can finally connect to it wirelessly and start working on it on my own Macbook. The internal ip address of Baglebone can be found in the output of `ifconfig` with label `inet address` under `wlan0` section. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 2c:f7:f1:06:6b:54\n",
    "          inet addr:128.97.180.16  Bcast:128.97.180.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can start working on our Baglebone on my own laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Server Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We executed `ssh-keygen` to generate public and private keys in our Baglebone server. I choose not to add passphrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Then we executed `sudo useradd -d /home/guest/ -m guest` to create a guest account for other people to remotely connect to. We also used `sudo passwd guest` to add a password to the guest account.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Then we created a `.ssh` directory for the new user by first changing directory into it with `cd /home/guest/` and then `sudo mkdir .ssh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because we created `.ssh` with `sudo`, it is owned by `root` user. We now need to change the ownership on `.ssh` directory with `sudo chown -R guest .ssh`. Then we will change it permission with `sudo chmod 700 .ssh` so that it will not be edited by unintended users.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will now disable password-based authentication so that users can only connect to the server through `ssh` agent. It ensures that only permitted users can access the server and reduce the risk of attacks from leaked passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Client Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will set up the clients to get connected to our Baglebone server. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I have already generated public and private keys when working with Github, so I do not have to generate them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Then we copied the public key to the server for key-based authentication with `ssh-copy-id â€“i guest@128.97.180.16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will now add the private key to authentication agent so that we will not need to type our password every time using `ssh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally we can `ssh` to the server with `ssh -X guest@128.97.180.16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The X forwarding works like a charm. I can run firefox on my Baglebone and see it on my own laptop."
